Playwright end-to-end specs, run against a live Vite dev server
(`playwright.config.ts`: `baseURL http://localhost:4242`, chromium only,
`bun run dev` auto-started). Run with `bun run test:e2e` — never part of
`bun run test` (that's vitest unit/integration only).

- `homepage.spec.ts` / `routing.spec.ts` — core page render + route coverage.
- `loadout.spec.ts` — the ripperdoc bench end-to-end: equip → conflict →
  resolve → share-URL restores the build.
- `responsive.spec.ts` — mobile viewport (375×812) has no horizontal overflow.
- `a11y.spec.ts` — accessibility landmarks (e.g. skip-to-content link).
- `artifacts.spec.ts` — /artifacts shelf → viewer navigation, the doc iframe
  actually loading, the raw static doc under `public/artifact-docs/`, and the
  hidden-shelf unlock (terminal passphrase → reveal → routed; reduced-motion
  and full-motion) plus the nav-absence check.
- `weekly.spec.ts` — /weekly run log → viewer navigation, the report iframe
  actually loading, and the raw static report under `public/artifact-docs/weekly/`.

Specs drive the real app through the browser, not component internals —
prefer role/label queries over CSS selectors, matching the existing specs.
